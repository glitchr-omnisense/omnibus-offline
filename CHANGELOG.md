## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-11-13

The first stable 2.x release: it installs with Composer's default minimum-stability (stable).

### Release
- Requires `omnisense/contracts` `^1.0` and `omnisense/omnibus` `^2.0`, stable versions, where it
  required `@dev` ones; `extra.branch-alias` `dev-2.x` → `2.x-dev`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (glitchr-studio/ci's php-package.yml: the package installed alone,
  PHPUnit, PHPStan against its baseline, a consumer install) and `release.yml` (that CI on the tag,
  then glitchr-studio/ci's php-release.yml); `phpunit.xml.dist` runs the package's own tests.
- README: the install line and a first call with configured rates (no account, no network).

### Added
- On omnisense/contracts: the carrier's usage policy as data (`policy.json`, named in
  `composer.json`'s `extra.omnisense.policy`; docs/index.md, Usage policy), and its waits honoured:
  the API client takes the gateway's Backoff, a 429 is a `RateLimitedException`, the next calls are
  held unsent, nothing is retried. Requires omnisense/contracts. `phpstan.neon` at level max,
  `phpstan-baseline.neon` what was there.

### Removed
- `Resources/views/Action/shipping.html.twig` and `tracking.html.twig`: two empty files nothing
  referenced.
